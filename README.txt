ColorStack Terminal Adventure â€” Robust Unlock Edition

How to start:
  cd ~/ColorStack_Terminal_Adventure/crime_scene
  cat report.txt

Unlock order (password files live in the locked folders):
  suspects_locked/password.txt  -> unlocks suspects
  evidence_locked/password.txt  -> unlocks evidence
  finale_locked/password.txt    -> unlocks finale

You can run unlock scripts from:
  - crime_scene/unlock.sh  (unlocks suspects), OR
  - inside each locked folder (suspects_locked/unlock.sh, evidence_locked/unlock.sh, finale_locked/unlock.sh)

Basic commands: ls, ls -a, cd, cat, echo, bash
