ColorStack Terminal Adventure â€” Finale-Only Lock Edition

All clues and suspects are visible from the start for demo/training purposes.
Only the final reveal is locked: you'll need the final password to run the reveal.
This is ideal for instructors who want students to practice navigation & clue-reading
without the incremental password puzzles.

Start:
  cd ~/ColorStack_Terminal_Adventure_FINALONLY/homes/detective
  cat notes.txt

Finale unlock:
  - Put the final password into finale_locked/password.txt
  - Run finale_locked/unlock.sh to reveal the finale folder
  - Create culprit.txt and run finale/reveal.sh
